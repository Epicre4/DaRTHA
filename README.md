# DaRTHA
A discord bot that shows and analyzes server related data for growth purposes

This bot contains / commands that can be used in discord to access and analyze data related to specified channels and users tags.

This bot will in future contain machine learning algorithms to create more 'predictive' and stat based solutions for server owners who seek to increase growth on a server.

Current / commands include:

/stats (Get's the last 100 messages on a channel and tells how many words, characters and emojis were sent, and a date time with the most active moment with text messages)

/numberofmessages (Shows the number of messages sent in a day, for now this command may be inconsistent in working for now as I still don't have a server for hosting this bot but I'll be buying a server in the upcoming months so then this bot should stay quite active all the time)
